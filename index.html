<p id="one">Modern football is ever increasing in its reactionary and small-minded approach to the sport. People often forget that there was football before pele rose shone and showed us the way. But there was a time before that. A time of highly skilled and profilic players, dedicated to learning their craft and honing their attributes. There may as much footage or documentation but from what there is, we must understand what football was to truly understand football as it is today.</p>

<p id="two">Football had visionaries, like everything else, and it is vital we do not forget those that made the game as we see it today. Once, Herbert Chapman's 'WM' formation was the tactical brilliance that everyone admired, before that it was the 1-1-8 and the 2-3-5 formations that ruled supreme. There wasn't offisdes, but yet again, the goalkeeper could pick up passes from defenders until 1992, so the game has been evolving since its dawn and we constantly disregard history because the game has changed, but the game is always evolving. Whether its Gary Neville and his peers commenting and debating the rules and officiating, or the introduction of new technology for us to marvel at, until we throw our toys out i=of the pram because 'the rules are silly' or the 'technology doesn't work'.</p>

<p id="three">My point is, football changes and it has since it started, and while we are progressing at a faster rate than anyother time in human history, it is just as important to admire and appreciate those that allow us to witness the brilliance of Messi, Ronaldo and the players who are highlighted on 'Match of The Day', as without them we would be sat watching the same things we call primitive and tame. Everything is relative right?</p>
