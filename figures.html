<p><u><b>Jimmy Hogan</b></u></p>
</div>

<p>30 miles away from Etihad Stadium, a young Jimmy Hogan, in 1882 was born. He would be laughed out of England some 25 years later be  commemorated, though post-houmous, "the biggest influence on football of all time", by writer, Johnathan Wilson. Without his mind and tactical foresight and no-least his courage to leave the stagnant and imperialistic Britain to spread his ideas and help evolve the 'world's game' around the continent, we may never have seen such players like Matthias Sindelar, Puskas, Kocsis,a team like the Austrian Wunderteam, the Magical Magyars or the Ajax and Dutch national team of the 70s come so early.</p> 

<p>As such, there is a particular domino effect when analysing Hogan's influence as without his innovation, teams we admire today may have been reserved for the next generations or never have come to fruition. Hundreds of millions of fans in awe and billions spent trying to emulate the foundations he set some hundred years ago, truly highlight and emphasise his influence and place among the game's greatest people. </p>


<img src="images/download.jpg" alt="Jimmy Hogan" style="float:left; margin-right:5px; margin-bottom:8px;"> 

<p><span style="margin-bottom:20px;">James Hogan was born in 1882 into an Irish Catholic family in Nelson, Lancashire, the son of mill worker James Hogan. He grew up in nearby Burnley and received his education at St Mary Magdalene Roman Catholic School in Burnley.[2] His father wanted Hogan to enter priesthood and sent him to study as a boarder at the Salford Diocesan Junior Seminary St Bede's College, Manchester in September 1896. Hogan graduated at midsummer 1900 after deciding not to pursue his vocation any further, although he was College Head Boy in the 1899–1900 Academic Year. Hogan was a promising young inside forward, and in 1903, he was the first signing of Burnley's new secretary-manager, Spen Whittaker. Despite being a first team regular, he felt undervalued and in 1905, he asked to be paid the maximum wage, which was £4 a week. The club turned it down, so he left and joined Fulham. Hogan helped Fulham reach the FA Cup semi-final in 1907–08 before joining Swindon Town and then Bolton Wanderers. During a pre-season tour Bolton beat Dutch club FC Dordrecht 10–0; Hogan vowed to return to Dordrecht in order to "teach those fellows how to play properly". In 1910, Hogan accepted a two-year contract at Dordrecht and set about improving the team in fitness and ball control, as well as implementing the Combination Game. Impressed by his methods, the Royal Dutch Football Association recruited Hogan to manage the Netherlands in a friendly against Germany in October 1910, which Hogan's side won 2–1. Due to his success Hogan also briefly coached Wiener Amateur-SV in 1911 and 1912. Upon the expiry of his contract with Dordrecht in 1912, Hogan returned for a final season as a player at Bolton before returning to Vienna to coach the Austria national football team.[5] However, the outbreak of World War I meant that he was interned as a foreign prisoner of war, but was smuggled to the Hungarian border. He moved to Budapest, where he was allowed out of captivity to coach at MTK Budapest between 1914 and 1918. Hogan laid the foundations for MTK's domination of Hungarian football, as they won ten domestic titles in a row between 1913–14 and 1924–25. In 1917 Hogan was allowed to go home to be reunited with his family, but found a sour reception. He was told that men who had suffered financially as a result of the war could claim £200 from the F.A. Hogan was almost destitute, but when he went to the FA the secretary, Francis Wall, opened a cupboard and offered him a pair of khaki socks. 'We sent these to the boys at the front and they were grateful.' The unsubtle message was: 'traitor' and and and and na dn and and and and an dna dn when she went to the building she went inot the room wtih the big dog and sh sat down and then jimmy hogan walked in and sat down next tothe bog dog and and when he jimmy hogan the third ssat down the king arrived and then they hadna apartu. </span></p>


<p><u><b> Archie Hunter </b></u></p>

<p>One of Victorian football's first superstars, he won the FA Cup with Aston Villa, being the first captain in the club's history to lift the trophy. Born in Scotland, he played for local side Ayr Thistle and Third Lanark (being on the losing side of the 1878 Scottish Cup final with the latter), before he joined Villa in August of 1878, just 4 years after their creation. His career at Villa had started 10 years before the formation of The Football League and during the two years (88-90) in which he played in the league he contributed 42 goals in 73 matches. While being one of the greats of the 1880s, the only goal he never got to score was playing for his country, due to the Scottish FA not picking Scottish players who play for English clubs. This rule would however be lifted in 1896. During a league game against Everton, in 1890, Hunter would suffer a heart attack and would never play football again. Archie Hunter died in 1894, aged just 35. It is said that on his death-bed, he would ask to be lifted up one last time to see the crowd going to Perry Barr. He given the epithet: "prince of dribblers" ; and was an individualist with a commanding personality, yet robust and skillful. It was often said it was not unusual for him to pick the ball up in his own half and dribble through the whole opposing team and make them dig the ball out of their net. ​</p>

<p>He was the crown jewel of a true footballing family, namely, his brother Andy, who would score Villa's first ever FA Cup goal, and his other brother John, a Scottish international in his own right. ​</p>

<p>He was inducted into the Football League's list of 100 legends, in 1998, over a hundred years after his passing would his genius and skill still be recognized and admired again. A commemorative monument was erected, outside the club he helped forge into the history books, to honor his legacy for a hundred years more to come. ​</P>

<p><span>One of Victorian football's fist superstars, he won the FA Cup with Aston Villa, being the first captain in the club's history to lift the trophy. Born in Scotland, he played for local side Ayr Thistle and Third Lanark (being on the losing side of the 1878 Scottish Cup final with the latter), before he joined Villa in August of 1878, just 4 years after their creation.

This rule would however be lifted in 1896. During a league game against Everton, in 1890, Hunter would suffer a heart attack and would never play football again. Archie Hunter died in 1894, aged just 35. It is said that on his death-bed, he would ask to be lifted up one last time to see the crowd going to Perry Barr. He given the epithet: "prince of dribblers" ; and was an individualist with a commanding personality, yet robust and skillful. It was often said it was not unusual for him to pick the ball up in his own half and dribble through the whole opposing team and make them dig the ball out of their net. Born in Joppa near Ayr, Hunter played for Ayr Thistle and Third Lanark (featuring on the losing side in the 1878 Scottish Cup Final)[2] before signing for Aston Villa in August 1878, four years after their formation. His Aston Villa career began 10 years before the commencement of the first Football League season. In his league career (1888–1890) he played 73 matches scoring 42 goals. Also his 33 goals for Villa in the FA Cup (including 3 in 1888–1889) remains the club record in the competition.[3] Hunter made his League debut on 15 September 1888 at Wellington Road, as a forward, against Stoke. Aston Villa won 5–1 and Hunter scored one of the goals. He missed three League games (out of 22) in 1888–89 and scored seven League goals including one brace.[4]

Despite being one of the greats of the 19th century game, Hunter never fulfilled his dream of playing for Scotland against England. This is because at the time the Scottish Football Association had a policy of not picking 'Anglo-Scots' (i.e. Scots who played in the English League) which persisted until 1896.[5]

Hunter originally came to Birmingham planning to sign for Calthorpe F.C., but was persuaded to sign for Villa instead, ostensibly after hearing of Aston Villa's Scottish connections, although, given Hunter "had become acquainted with the Calthorpe Football Club" when in Scotland, and given Calthorpe had been founded and run by Scots, and played in Scottish colours, this rationale is questionable. Calthorpe's links with Queen's Park F.C. meant the club was resolutely amateur, unlike Villa. Hunter later recalled in his memoirs;           </span></p>

<p><u><b>Michel Platini</b></u></p>

<p>Three Ballon d'Or's in a row and a corruption scandal later, Michel Platini is one of the greatest players of all time. Born from Italian ancestry, he has many ties to both France and Italy personally and throughout his career. His father was a professional footballer and long-term director of AS Nancy, the team he joined in 1972. After scoring a hat-trick in a reserve match, he was quick to make an impression and he would go on to achieve 127 goals in 213 matches for the club and lift the Coupe de France. He joined Saint-Etienne in 1979 and with the club signing him in hopes European glory, he would only muster a single first division title in his time and would participate in 82 goals in 145 games for 'Les Verts'. </p>

<p>His turn in Turin would be more fruitful ,however, and 2 Serie As, a European Cup, this time around, and a Cup Winner's Cup, along with several individual awards, being awarded with the league's top scorer in three consecutive seasons and a hat-trick of European footballer of the year awards, would see the Frenchman be the Blues' star player throughout the 80s and perhaps of all time, leading them to European Championship glory on home soil. He scored a record 9 goals of France's 14 goals at the tournament.</p>

<p>He later became UEFA President and was found guilty, along with Sepp Blatter for ethics violations, and for "unlawfully arranging for FIFA to pay Michel £1.7million and was consequently barred from football until 2023. However,  the two were later acquitted of the charge in 2022.</p>

<img src="images/Platini.jpg" alt="Platini holding Ballon d'Or" style="float:left; margin-bottom: 8px; margin-right:5px;">

<span><p> Platini was quick to make a big impression at his new club, scoring a hat-trick in a reserve team match against Wittelsheim. Further outstanding displays put him in contention for a place in the Nancy first team. His introduction to the first-team squad was inauspicious. On the substitutes' bench for a match against Valenciennes, Platini was spat on and hit by various objects thrown from the crowd when a fight broke out in the stands. Playing for the reserves a few days later, a hefty challenge from an opponent left Platini with a bad ankle injury. His season would finish on a more positive note, and he would go on to make his league debut against Nîmes on 3 May 1973.

In March 1974, he suffered a setback when he sustained a double fracture of his left arm in a match at OGC Nice. Platini missed the remainder of the season as a result, unable to assist Nancy in an unsuccessful bid to avoid relegation from Ligue 1. The following season saw Nancy win promotion back to the French first division with ease. Platini became the team's most important player, scoring 17 goals, a number of which were scored from free-kicks, as was becoming Platini's specialty. Saint-Étienne, the then reigning French league champions, were knocked out of the French Cup with two goals from Platini free-kicks. Platini practised his free-kicks with the help of his friend, goalkeeper Moutier, and using a row of dummies to form a defensive wall of sorts.

With Nancy back in Ligue 1, Platini's military service reduced his availability for matches, but he continued to make himself available to play when possible. In a match away to Laval, Platini, angered by the taunts of the home supporters, scored a hat-trick, but unluckily sustained another injury. Press reports claimed that Platini's season was over and that he would require a knee operation, but neither claim proved to be correct. Instead, Platini returned to first-team football two weeks later for Nancy's French Cup semi-final against Marseille at the Parc des Princes. Platini headed the only Nancy goal in their 4–1 loss and was forced to leave the field injured. Following his participation in the 1976 Montreal Olympics, Platini signed a two-year contract with Nancy, his first professional contract.

Before travelling to Argentina for the World Cup, Platini won the first major trophy of his playing career, captaining Nancy to victory in the 1978 French Cup final against Nice and scoring the only goal of the game. President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing presented him with the trophy. However, with the World Cup scheduled to start two weeks after the cup final, there was little time left for preparation.</span></p>

<p><u><b>Ernst Happel</b></u></p>

<p>The first of six managers to win a European Cup with two different clubs, one of six managers to win a top-flight domestic championship in at least four countries, Ernst Happel is sitting on the same table as many of the greats of football coaching. He started playing professional football at age 17 for Rapid Vienna as a star defender. He would play for 14 years at the club and 2 for RC Paris, alongside 51 appearances for the Austrian national team, whom he guided to third place at the 1954 World Cup, even after the greats of the 30s. After retiring, he became one of the greatest coaches of all time, leading Feyenoord to European Cup and Eredivisie glory, the Netherlands national team to silver at the 78 World cup, without the enigmatic Cruyff, and Hamburger to a European cup victory, with many more honors to laud over, including, but not limited to: 2 Bundesliga crowns, three-time Belgium Championship winner (with Club Brugge) and back-to-back Austrian league titles.</P> 

<p>France Football would rank him 9th among the greatest managers of all time. While it was the likes of Hogan, Cruyff, Michels and Guardiola, who are most often credited for the creation and mastery of 'Total Football', it was happel who tactically out-classed Michels to win the league and to win the European Cup first, laying the cement on top of the foundations of the Dutch's early dominance of club and international of the 1970s.</p>

<img src="Happel.jpg" alt="Ernst Happel">

<p><u><b>Gusztav Sebes</b></u></p>

<p>"Part of the joy of football is that the best team doesn't always win"; this holds true with many of the great footballing teams of the past, perhaps most notably with the Dutch, due to their persistence, longevity and credited innovation. However, one team may have even higher credentials than the 'Oranje'. The Magical Magyars featured many of the greatest players of the 1900s and some of the greatest of all time.</p>

<p>Lead by innovator and heavily political Gusztav Sebes, the team would hold the world record for the longest run an international team would accomplish and a record of only 1 loss in 50 matches. This loss, however, would be the match that mattered most and would only spark more tension in a politically unstable nation, that would potentially rob the team from a second chance at glory.</p>

<p>During their anguish it was, simultaneously, "a kind of liberation for the Germans from all the things that had weighed them down upon them after the Second World War"., journalist Joachim Fest later wrote. A fitting sight of emotional redemption for the winners and the final 'nail in the coffin' for the Hungarians. As it would be, the Hungarian revolution would drive atleast 200,000 Hungarians to seek refuge, including some of its most talented players. 

This great team would reach its pinnacle in the 'Match of the Century' against the English, with a sense of irony, as Sebes remarked after the match: "We played football as Jimmy Hogan taught us", a man laughed out of England for his ideas had now inflicted the punishment of Britain's arrogance in the cruelest sense of the word towards his home nation. The English were heavy favourites and did not concede a chnace that they would be on the losing side, let alone a losing side that had very little in hope throughout, if anything, the scoreline (6-3) flattered the home side and this would be cast as a warning to all over nations that there were not scared and had the abnility to out play everyone. The story of the Magic Magyars is a tragic one at best, but its glory years live on in its legacy and the foundations it produced for other great teams and players alike.</p>

<p><u><b>Johan Cruyff</b></u></p>

<p>Johan Cruyff, often cited as the 'father ofdern football', was one of the gratest footballers of all-time. He is best known for his accomplishments on the field: helping popularise 'Total Football' with his teacher, Rinus Michels, and leading Ajax to three consecutive European Cups, the Dutch national team to to its first World in decades and them to silver. While categorized as a failure, this tournament, with the increase in technology and viewership, showed the world a style of play that many consider the purist and most entertaining. It wasn't create by Michels, but perfected, using Cruyff as his brush and the pitch his canvas; they would take Europe by storm and revolutionise the modern game. </p>
<p>
He was an idealist and a stubborn, individualist, collectivist and romantic, in his own right. A complicated figure to manage and tame, and not many did, he would lead by example and stand up for his principles all throughout his life, speaking against his national team, playing against and criticsing the clubs he represented and loved. He was at the very minimum, one of the most talented players the World's ever seen, winning the Ballon d'Or (European player of the year) three times. </p>

<span>It was of course only natural he would pursue coaching after his playing days, and it didn't take long and he was at the helm, once again, leading Ajax. His time there would be somewhat successful: winning the Cup Winners'and two KNVB Cups. He later rejoined his former team, Barcelona, as head coach, and started to implement the style he played in the Netherlands, that gained him trememdous accolade. He made sure the youth teams would follow this style to ensure they could be easily transitioned into the first team. Due to the club's financial issues, at the time, he needed to get creative with his puchases and with his youth team graduates, with standouts being: Pep Guardiola, Txiki Begiristain, Hristo Stoichkov, Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman and Romario. He created Barca's 'Golden Team', perhaps only out shone now by Guardiola's side in the late 2000s, that included a Cup Winner's Cup, their first European Cup, the Copa Del rey, and four La Liga trophies in a row. He was, again until his disciple Pep guardiola, the club's longest serving and most successful manager of all time. His relationship between him and the Catalans was always great and in solidarity, even represented in his son's name, Jordi, but this was only hightened by him leading the Catalan national team thirteen years after his last managerial job.</span>

<p>A philanthropist, he created the Johan Cruyff Foundation to help support children in struggling areas to get access to pitches to play football together in the streets, something he credits for his footballing ability. He was a man who inspired a generation of players and who has gone down in the history books as a man who helped whomever he could, by putting himself in positions to make a real change, a person who entertained and inspired, and a husband who chose his principles and family over one more chance to solidify his greatness in the sport, eternally. </p>
