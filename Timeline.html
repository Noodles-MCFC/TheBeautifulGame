<p id="origins"><u>The origins</u></p>

<p>Football, as we know it today, is said to have be formed in Eton and Rugby schools, the later's form of the sport would become the sport of the same name). However, before this, the Mesoamerican cultures played a game involving a ball of rock, though there is not much information regarding its rules, the premise of using a round object for sport would contine, in China no less. Between the 3rd and 2nd century BC, the Chinese, played a game called Cuju whihc involved a round ball, stitched with leather, fur or feathers, on a square area. Other versions of these games would take place in Japan and Greece. It's said that games that more closely resembled our game developed in England in the 12th century. During these games, kicking the ball was more common than other varieties, but punching the ball with the fist was commonplace: it was a much more violent and rough way of playing than the modern way of playing. This game would spread to Florenece (Italy) and games would be played with many participants and in large areas, with these being labeled a "rampage", with much damage to the town and even death to players. It was later forbidden. This was until schools had adopted the game and the popularity would increase among the two schools, mentioned earlier. It was at Eton where the game begun to resemble what we know and love. Eton called it "the dribbling game" and it was played exclusivly with the feet. </p>

<p>The schools struggled with standardised rules and there was a meeting at Cambridge in 1848, but there was no final solution to the questions of the rules. In 1863, the first football association was formed in England (the FA). This meeting would be more fruitful than the previous, and it was decided that carrying the ball wasn't allowed and that the size and weight of the ball should also be standardised around. Because of the meeting, and the game Rugby played, the game was divided into two codes: association football and rugby. This may seem like a giant leap forward for the 'beautiful game', but there were major discrepencies between this game and ours. For one, there were no crossbars for the first few years, when in 1866, in an effort to reduce controversy, tape was a requirement and it was in place for the first FA Cup final in 1872. The crossbar became mandatory in 1882. As well as this, the goal net was introduced for the first timein the next decade and the 1892 FA Cup final between the Midland clubs Aston Villa and West Bromwich Albion, became the first match to use both goalposts and a net. Furthermore, if the ball crossed the sideline, the throw (which was taken with one hand, though this was not practised in Scotland) would be taken by the player who got to the ball first. Initially it was each team's captains that were entrusted to keep order. But, after the FA Cup was established, it was decided two referees should decide matters if the captains could not.</p>

<p>When describing football that resembles 'football', the oldest club to have official status was Sheffield FC in 1857, although some historians believe Foot-Ball Club formed in Edinburgh in 1824 was, in-fact, the oldest club. Industrialisation in Britain led to larger groups and meetings of people congregating in factories, pubs and churches and, as a result, football tams were established within the larger cities and emerging railroads could allow matches to take place. In the beginning, football was dominated by school teams, as with its origins, but later, factory workers would mkae up the majority. Some teams would, illegally, pay for the best players to join their team. This would start a period of transition, with much frictions from the FA, but the game would later become professional in 1885. During the 1880s the game had popularised and tickets were being sold to fans attending matches. Three years after its professional status wa slegalised, the Footall League was established. Throughout its first season, 12 clubs joined the league. The league was so successful, more clubs became interested in joining and the competition would be expanded into more divisions. </p>

<span id="originspic">Although much emphasis is placed on retaining possession of the ball and dictating play, with the intent to have the opposing side's defence chase the ball for extended periods of play, Guardiola's teams are recognised for pressing off the ball. Players press and harry the opposition collectively in an attempt to win back possession of the ball. This collective press is only conducted in the starting third of the opposition's pitch where less space exists and defenders and/or the goalkeeper may not be as good at dribbling or passing the ball as a midfielder.The schools struggled with standardised rules and there was a meeting at Cambridge inn 1848, but there was no final solution to the questions of the rules.
