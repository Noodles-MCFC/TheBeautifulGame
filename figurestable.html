    <td>James Hogan was born in 1882 into an Irish Catholic family in Nelson, Lancashire, the son of mill worker James Hogan. He grew up in nearby Burnley and received his education at St Mary Magdalene Roman Catholic School in Burnley.[2] His father wanted Hogan to enter priesthood and sent him to study as a boarder at the Salford Diocesan Junior Seminary St Bede's College, Manchester in September 1896. Hogan graduated at midsummer 1900 after deciding not to pursue his vocation any further, although he was College Head Boy in the 1899–1900 Academic Year. Hogan was a promising young inside forward, and in 1903, he was the first signing of Burnley's new secretary-manager, Spen Whittaker. Despite being a first team regular, he felt undervalued and in 1905, he asked to be paid the maximum wage, which was £4 a week. The club turned it down, so he left and joined Fulham. Hogan helped Fulham reach the FA Cup semi-final in 1907–08 before joining Swindon Town and then Bolton Wanderers. During a pre-season tour Bolton beat Dutch club FC Dordrecht 10–0; Hogan vowed to return to Dordrecht in order to "teach those fellows how to play properly". In 1910, Hogan accepted a two-year contract at Dordrecht and set about improving the team in fitness and ball control, as well as implementing the Combination Game. Impressed by his methods, the Royal Dutch Football Association recruited Hogan to manage the Netherlands in a friendly against Germany in October 1910, which Hogan's side won 2–1. Due to his success Hogan also briefly coached Wiener Amateur-SV in 1911 and 1912. Upon the expiry of his contract with Dordrecht in 1912, Hogan returned for a final season as a player at Bolton before returning to Vienna to coach the Austria national football team.[5] However, the outbreak of World War I meant that he was interned as a foreign prisoner of war, but was smuggled to the Hungarian border. He moved to Budapest, where he was allowed out of captivity to coach at MTK Budapest between 1914 and 1918. Hogan laid the foundations for MTK's domination of Hungarian football, as they won ten domestic titles in a row between 1913–14 and 1924–25. In 1917 Hogan was allowed to go home to be reunited with his family, but found a sour reception. He was told that men who had suffered financially as a result of the war could claim £200 from the F.A. Hogan was almost destitute, but when he went to the FA the secretary, Francis Wall, opened a cupboard and offered him a pair of khaki socks. 'We sent these to the boys at the front and they were grateful.' The unsubtle message was: 'traitor'.
